Hello! Part of the instructions were to put in explanations for a few portions of the work. Here are the explanations:

1. Data Source: This dataset is a synthetic collection of 3000 rows simulating information about Netflix movies and TV shows. It is designed to capture details such as content type, genre, release year, ratings, duration, and production country. This was sourced from Kaggle.

2. The data I got was a lot of information from a subject I like. 

3. I picked fill because the Ratings were filled to maintain usability since ratings like "Not Rated" still provide context. I also used Drop for Rows missing titles were dropped because a title is critical for analysis.

5. Summery of data. 
Comedy is the most common genre, accounting for 30% of the data.

Releases increased steadily after 2000, with the 2010s being the most productive decade.

6. Summery of findings:
Netflix's content strategy has increasingly focused on Comedy and Drama genres

The 2010s marked a significant rise in content releases, reflecting Netflix's global expansion.

Recommendations for next actions or further analysis:
Consider exploring underserved genres like documentaries to attract niche audiences.
Analyze user feedback to identify emerging trends in content preferences.
